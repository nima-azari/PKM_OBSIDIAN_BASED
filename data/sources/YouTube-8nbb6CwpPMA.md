## Welcome to the OntoText Webinar

Hello everyone, my name is Jason Stokov, and I want to welcome you all to our latest OntoText webinar. This is our second webinar for January and the first one of the year with our speaker, Atanas Kirakov, the CEO of OntoText. The topic of today's discussion is how RDF levels the advantages of labeled property graphs, focusing on three key benefits: standards, semantics, and interoperability. 

### Introducing Atanas Kirakov

Atanas Kirakov is the founder and CEO of OntoText. He holds a master's degree in AI from Sofia University and is a board member of the Linked Data Benchmarking Council. Additionally, he is a partner and part of the board of directors at Sirima Holding Group, one of the largest IT companies in Bulgaria. Atanas is a top expert in graph databases, knowledge graphs, and many surrounding technologies.

### Housekeeping Details

Before we begin, here are a few housekeeping details. This webinar is live and will be recorded, with the recording distributed to all participants possibly by tomorrow. Currently, everyone is muted to minimize background noise and allow Atanas to present without interruptions. However, you can communicate with us using the question box in your GoToWebinar panel. We strongly encourage you to ask questions, as we have a planned Q&A session at the end of the webinar.

Now, without further ado, I would like to hand over the stage to Atanas. Atanas, the floor is yours.

## Presentation by Atanas Kirakov

Thank you for joining us today. Let’s start with a quick introduction. I founded OntoText in the year 2000 during the pioneering years of the semantic web. Since then, we have been part of a community focused on advancing the way we handle content, semantics, and data to create a more connected and automated environment. 

### Our Journey and Current Focus

Over the last 22 years, we have undergone various transformations and faced challenges in our quest to improve data management. Today, we are primarily known for developing GraphDB, a leading database engine, and for our work with knowledge graphs. We are proud to be at the center of an ecosystem of over 20 partners, and we have a diverse and growing client base that includes multinational companies across various sectors such as banking, finance, healthcare, and national security.

### The Importance of RDF

Our commitment to the semantic web and data standardization is evident through our participation in various organizations like W3C. RDF (Resource Description Framework) and related query languages play a crucial role in this ecosystem. 

To illustrate our approach, consider the challenge of integrating proprietary information within enterprises. This involves mapping and linking diverse datasets to create a unified view of enterprise knowledge. Our unique approach leverages extensive domain knowledge, allowing us to enhance proprietary information by contextualizing it, much like a human expert would.

### Knowledge Graphs and Technology

At OntoText, we focus on knowledge graph management, which involves building, storing, indexing, and querying knowledge graphs. Our technology aims to provide better results and comprehensive outputs in less time. We have developed a solid offering for several capabilities, including database engine operations, analytics, and visualization, while also partnering with leading technology providers for areas outside our core focus.

### Advantages of RDF Over Labeled Property Graphs

The main topic of this webinar is how RDF addresses the historical advantages of labeled property graphs. For instance, property graphs allow for the attachment of properties to edges, a feature traditionally absent in RDF. However, recent advancements, such as RDF-star, enable the attachment of metadata to edges, significantly enhancing RDF's capabilities.

### RDF-Star: A Game Changer

RDF-star allows users to make statements about statements, thus enriching the metadata associated with relationships in the graph. This is a significant improvement over earlier methods, which often required complex workarounds. RDF-star simplifies the process of attaching expressive metadata, making it easier to manage and utilize.

We have conducted experiments comparing RDF-star implementations with traditional methods, demonstrating measurable gains in efficiency when using RDF-star in GraphDB.

### Graph Traversal and Performance

Next, we will delve into graph traversal, a computationally intensive task. Finding paths in a graph can be challenging, but our extended SPARQL syntax allows for efficient path searching. This functionality is crucial for applications such as navigation, supply chain analysis, and social network analysis.

We benchmarked our graph path search extension against other engines, confirming that our approach not only meets but exceeds performance expectations in many cases. 

### The Value of Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs excel in scenarios where comprehensive domain knowledge is required. They enable organizations to unify diverse datasets and extract insights efficiently. This is particularly important in fields such as life sciences, finance, and infrastructure management, where understanding complex relationships is crucial.

### Conclusion and Q&A

In conclusion, RDF provides explicit semantics, interoperability, and a structured approach to metadata management that is essential for effective data governance. While labeled property graphs have their advantages in specific scenarios, RDF's comprehensive features make it a superior choice for enterprise-level applications involving knowledge graphs.

Thank you for your attention. I would now like to open the floor for questions. We appreciate your engagement and will ensure that all inquiries are addressed, whether during the session or afterward via email with the recording. 

Thank you once again for joining us today, and I look forward to our discussion!
